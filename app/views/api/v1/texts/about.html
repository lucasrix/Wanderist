      <h1>About us</h1>
      <p>We are a cross-continental group of map-passionate folks that love stories, and maps (did we say that already?). We set out to create a totally new, and meaningful way to discover place. We believe everyone is creative, everyone is an explorer, and everyone has a story, small and large. We'd love to hear from you (info@maplifyapp.com).</p>
      <h2>About Maplify</h2>
      <p>Maplify lets you explore stories that happen in a place - your neighborhood, a place youâ€™re visiting or want to visit, where your friends are. What does it [feel, look, sound, taste] like there? Our lives happen in places. Maplify lets you capture your story, and WHERE it happens. The places and moments of how you fell in love, experiences shared by you and your friends while an a spontaneous trip, a kindness you witnessed on your daily bus ride to work. Your life on a map.</p>
      <p>- the Maplify team</p>
